# MoviePicker

Assignment Description:
You have been tasked with creating a simple iOS app that allows users to search for movies and view their details. The app should make use of the Movie Database API (https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api) to retrieve movie information.
Requirements:

    The app should have two screens: a search screen and a details screen.
    The search screen should have a search bar that allows the user to search for movies by title. The search results should be displayed in a table view.
    The table view should display the movie title, release date, and poster image.
    The details screen should display additional information about the selected movie, including the movie title, release date, poster image, and overview.
    The app should cache search results for offline use.
    The app should handle error cases gracefully and provide feedback to the user when necessary.

Bonus points:

    Implement pagination in the search results table view.
    Allow users to save movies to a favorites list.
    Add unit tests and UI tests for your code.
    Offline mode: the app can persist the data previously fetched and see them when the app is opened in offline mode. 

Deliverables:

    A working iOS app that meets the above requirements.
    A README file with instructions for building and running the app.
    A brief write-up describing the decisions you made while building the app, any challenges you faced, and how you overcame them.
    Your source code, preferably hosted on a public repository such as GitHub.

Evaluation:
Your submission will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

    Functionality: Does the app meet the specified requirements?
    Code quality: Is the code clean, readable, and maintainable?
    Design: Is the app well-designed and easy to use?
    Performance: Does the app perform well and handle large datasets efficiently?
    Bonus points: Did you implement any of the bonus requirements?
